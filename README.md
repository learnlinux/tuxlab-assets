# tuxlab-assets
TuxLab is an open source platform for creating Interactive Linux Courses. This repository contains the assets for the Logo, Icons, Fonts and Design for TuxLab application.  If you are instead looking for the application source code itself, visit the [App Repository](https://github.com/learnlinux/tuxlab-app).

## Logo
The TuxLab logo is copyright the TuxLab Project, a project of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Colors

## User Interface
The TuxLab interface is developed entirely using [Angular 2 Material](https://github.com/angular/material2).  You should follow [Google's Material Style guide](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) whenever you are designing a component of the TuxLab project- be it an icon, UX item, or presentation.
